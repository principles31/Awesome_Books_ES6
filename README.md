# Awesome-Books with ES6
This project embodies a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list using ES6 syntax. JavaScript objects and arrays were used.

# Project requirements

> Setup your project:

- Create a new directory and initialize it with git.
- Use npm init -y command to create package.json file.
- Create the entry point for your JavaScript code called index.js
- Create index.css file for your styles.
- Create the main index.html file. Link your index.js and index.css files there.
- Create a directory called modules.
- Re-create your Awesome books app following the rules:

> Use ES6 syntax.
- Divide your code into modules. Save each module in a separate file in the modules dir. Import modules in the index.js file. For this exercise - the more modules the better!
- Keep all funcionalities of the app without errors.
- Refactor your methods and functions to arrow functions.
- Use let and const in a correct way.
- Display the current date below the navigation bar.

- For this requirement you should use a library Luxon
Download the script and save it to your project.
- Import it as a module.
- See the article Get the current date and time. Your task here is to use a new tool effectively with little externally curated support. Exactly as you will do in your future job.
